# Some Tkinter samples

- This repository is a collection of tkinter sample applications.
- Tkinter is a built-in GUI library of Python. During daily work, I found Tkinter is well suited to build some small tools very quickly compared to other languages such as C/C++.
- These samples demonstrate how to use tkinter widgets to create a GUI interface in Python. How to handle GUI events, like button clicks, choose menu items and mouse clicks etc.
- Hope they can help you in your own purpose.

## Dependencies
Some samples need extra packages been installed. These required packages are listed in the requirements.txt file in each sample's folder.
You can use the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install them.


## Running
